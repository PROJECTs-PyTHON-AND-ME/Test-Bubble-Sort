# Bubble Sort Demonstration in Python.

Educational implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm with several test cases and clean output format.

## Features.

- Early detection of already sorted lists (early termination).
- Does not modify the original list (uses a copy).
- Correct handling of special cases:
  - Empty list.
  - Single-element list.
  - Already sorted list.
  - List in reverse order (worst case).
- Formatted and easy-to-read output.
- Set of varied examples to demonstrate behavior.

## Requirements.

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- No external dependencies.

## Installation.
